# Steam-Auto-Shutdown
This is a very simple GUI to shutdown your pc after steam download finishes. 
Unlike any other program, this one looks for downloading files instead of internet connection. 
This way if your connection fails, your computer won't shutdown. Works both on Windows 10 (and propably on Linux).

How to use:


Step 1: Start steam download


Step 2: Start Steam-Auto-Shutdown


Step 3: Select steam download folder (search for your steam folder, which contains: common, downloading, temp etc., and select the folder downloading)


Step 4: Thats it!
