# Steam-Auto-Shutdown
This is a very simple code to shutdown your pc after steam download finishes. Unlike any other program, this one looks for downloading files instead of internet connection. This way if your connection fails, your computer won't shut off. Works both on Windows 10 (and propably on Linux)
