# Steam-Auto-Shutdown
This is a very simple GUI to shutdown your computer after steam download finishes. 
Unlike any other program, this one looks for downloading files instead of internet connection. 
This way if your connection fails, your computer won't shutdown. Works both on Windows 10 (and propably on Linux, not yet tested).


Functions:


- Selectable steam download(downloading) folder


- cancel shutdown after download finishes


How to insall:


Requirements: Python 3.0 or newer


Download file and open it with Python.


How to use:


Step 1: Start steam download


Step 2: Start Steam-Auto-Shutdown


Step 3: Select steam download folder (search for your steam folder, which contains: common, downloading, temp etc., and select the folder downloading)


Note:


- Make sure to put all games to queue! Or else it won't work.


- Workshop updates or anything which has to do with Workshop won't be recognized as downloads.


- If download finishes, your computer will shutdown after 60 seconds.



Step 4: Thats it!
