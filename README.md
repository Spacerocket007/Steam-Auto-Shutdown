# Steam-Auto-Shutdown
Who I am?
I am not a really coding experienced guy, who wrote this script out of fun and need.

This is a very simple GUI to shutdown your computer after steam download finishes. 
Unlike any other program, this one looks for downloading files instead of internet connection. 
This way if your connection fails, your computer won't shutdown. Works both on Windows 10 (and probably on Linux, not yet tested).

-----

Functions:


- Shutdown after download finishes


- cancel shutdown after download finishes


- Selectable steam download(downloading) folder

-----

How to install:


Requirements: Python 3.0 or newer (tested on Python 3.9)


Download file and open it with Python.

-----

How to use:


Step 1: Start steam download


Step 2: Start Steam-Auto-Shutdown


Step 3: Select steam download folder (search for your steam folder, the one which contains: common, downloading, temp etc.) and select the folder 'downloading'.


Note:


- Make sure to put everything (games/workshop/etc) to queue! Or else it won't work.


- Workshop updates or anything which has to do with Workshop won't be recognized as download.


- If download(s) finish(es), your computer will shutdown after 60 seconds.


Step 4: Thats it! :D
